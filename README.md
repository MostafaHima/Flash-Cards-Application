# Flash Cards Application

This is a Flash Cards application built with Python and Tkinter. The app helps learn English words by showing the word in English first and then showing the translation in Arabic after a brief delay.

## Features

- **Flash Cards**: The app displays a random English word, and after a short delay, it shows the translation in Arabic.
- **Interactive Buttons**: Users can mark the card as known or unknown using the right or wrong buttons.
